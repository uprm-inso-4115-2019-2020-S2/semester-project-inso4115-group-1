# Group 1 - Reserve and Dine
This repo will serve as the (temp) repo for where the documentation will be put. As of currently, this project is giving issues to setup Scala with. For now, the temporary fix for this will be making a separate GitHub where work will be managed and implemented. When work is finished, the last task is to merge that separate project repo with the document repo. Because of rotations, this project will be public to all and can be edited and even forked as they'd like.
